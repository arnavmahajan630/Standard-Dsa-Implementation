* Topological Sort

Only used of Directed Acyclic Graphs

Definition: Linear ordering of vertices such that if there is an edge between u & v
then u appears before v in that order

Dfs and add elements to the stack.

The intution:

- Directed Graph and Acyclic as in Definition
- Storing dfs of completed nodes

# Why not use a list instead of stack because it would fail on linear Graphs. 6->0->1->2->3
this would fail. if we must use list then we should keep reversing it.



* Kahn's Algorithm
Topological Sort BFS

basically same thing achieved through bfs

$ we can always say there will always be atleast 1 node who will have indegree as 0
this node can be start node for us. since it's not connected to anyone it has no bounds

$ We then remove connection to every other node connected to this node in queue and 
  if we do find another node with indegree we add it to queue and continue the process


=> A normal bfs push is wrong because
-  A-c B- c if root = A we get Acb if root is B we get bca but c must be ahead of both
a and we to satisfy topological sort.

## A node will only enter the sort if all of it's immediate neighbours are already in the sort

BOTH HAVE O(V + E)
