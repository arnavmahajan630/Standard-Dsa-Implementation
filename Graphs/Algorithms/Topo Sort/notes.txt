* Topological Sort

Only used of Directed Acyclic Graphs

Definition: Linear ordering of vertices such that if there is an edge between u & v
then u appears before v in that order

The intution:

- Directed Graph and Acyclic as in Definition
- Storing dfs of completed nodes

# Why not use a list instead of stack because it would fail on linear Graphs. 6->0->1->2->3
this would fail. if we must use list then we should keep reversing it.
